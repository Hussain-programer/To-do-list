# To-do-list
To-do-list using HTML CSS and JS
Sure, I'd be happy to explain the provided HTML code! This code represents a simple web-based to-do list application. The HTML document begins with the usual document type declaration and opens an HTML element with the 'en' attribute set for English language content. The content within the `<head>` section sets up the page's metadata, character encoding, viewport settings for responsiveness, and provides a title for the web page. Additionally, a link is included to an external stylesheet named "style.css" for styling the appearance of the page.

Moving on to the `<body>` section, the main content of the webpage is defined. Inside a `<div>` element with a class of "container," there's an `<h1>` heading displaying "Simple To-Do List," indicating the title of the application. Within the same `<div>`, there's another `<div>` with a class of "input-section." Inside this div, there's an `<input>` element of type "text" with an id of "taskInput" and a placeholder text prompting the user to enter their task. Next to the input, there's a `<button>` element with an `onclick` attribute set to "addTask()". This implies that when the button is clicked, a JavaScript function named "addTask()" will be called.

Further down, there's an unordered list `<ul>` with an id of "taskList." This is where the dynamically added tasks will appear. The HTML includes a commented-out example of what tasks might look like. Currently, a single task is statically included: "Total amount of milk is 135 Litres." Each task is wrapped in an `<li>` (list item) element. The intent is for tasks to be added dynamically through JavaScript, and this static example demonstrates the expected structure.

Finally, there's a `<script>` element with a "src" attribute pointing to an external JavaScript file named "app.js". This script file is expected to contain the JavaScript code responsible for adding tasks to the list dynamically and handling the button's click event.

In summary, the HTML code sets up the basic structure of a to-do list application. It defines input elements for users to add tasks and an area to display those tasks. The dynamic functionality is intended to be implemented using JavaScript, as indicated by the external script reference.
